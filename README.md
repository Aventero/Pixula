# What is this?
A sandbox pixel simulator similar to <a href="https://sandspiel.club">Sandspiel</a> by max bittker where most of the inspiration originated from.

# What can it do?
It simulates pixels with different materials or properties. Imagine <span style="color: #e8c170">sand </span> falling and forming sand pyramids or fire burning wood.

# How does it work?
The core simulation acts on each pixel with a set of rules that tell it how to behave. Take sand as an example, it has two simple rules: 
- Rule A: **Moving Down** until it can't.
- Rule B: **Down Diagonal** until it can't. <br>
Resulting in this behaviour: <br>
